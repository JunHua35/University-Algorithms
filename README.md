# Hello there!

#### This is a collection of my algorithms that I have used during my university course. 
#### Note that the algorithms may not be perfect and you are welcomed to debug them. Do let me know where did I go wrong with my code :D
##### Credit goes out to my uni friends that have helped me implement these algorithms. You guys are the best 💝
